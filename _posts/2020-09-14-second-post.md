## Avoiding Extra Costs When Hiring a Frontend Developer with a Good Eye for Design

In today's market, there are many frontend developers offering low hourly rates as freelancers, tempting some people or small companies to hire them in an effort to save money. However, this approach can often lead to unforeseen expenses. The main issue arises when the hired developer lacks a good eye for design, causing a chain of communication breakdowns and multiple revisions.

The problem begins with the web design phase, especially if the designer is not well-versed in development. When the design is passed to the frontend developer, they may miss crucial design details. As a result, a tedious back-and-forth process begins, involving constant communication with screenshots, videos, calls, and lengthy explanations of the required changes.

Let's take the example of a company called "Make it Real," where Frederick, the CEO, had a client looking to develop a new marketing strategy for their website. Working alongside the client's own developers, Frederick encountered challenges due to miscommunication between the design and development teams.

The process went as follows:

1. The web design was created by Luis, who lacked technical development knowledge.
2. Frederick would review the design and suggest technical improvements for development.
3. Luis sent the design to Frederick.
4. Frederick then shared it with the client's designers.
5. The developers worked on the project but missed many design details.
6. Frederick requested Luis and someone else to review the work and note down necessary changes.
7. Multiple reviews took place, leading to overlapping feedback and further delays.
8. Changes were sent back to the developers, but new mistakes and omissions occurred.
9. The cycle continued, causing frustration and significantly impacting the project's budget and timeline.

In this scenario, Frederick spent a considerable amount of time, diverting his attention from company growth and delaying other important tasks. The constant back-and-forth resulted in three times more time spent on checkups than anticipated, incurring substantial costs.

To avoid such complications and additional expenses, it is essential to have a frontend developer who possesses a strong design sense or a designer who understands development well. When developers and designers comprehend each other's expertise, they can collaborate more efficiently, leading to a smoother workflow, fewer errors, and a better end product.

Investing in a team of developers and designers who are familiar with each other's roles can be highly valuable. It ensures that critical design aspects like paddings, centered texts, alignment, headings, tags, colors, etc., are thoroughly considered before submitting changes for review. Moreover, developers with design knowledge are more likely to pay attention to details in their code.

If your budget allows, it is advisable to hire a cohesive team that shares a mutual understanding of each other's responsibilities. This way, you can focus your time on strategic aspects of your company, knowing that the development and design processes are in capable hands.
