# Python Syntax: Medical Insurance Project
Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. Using a formula that estimates a person's yearly insurance costs, you will investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.
## Setting up Factors
1. Our first step is to create the variables for each factor we will consider when estimating medical insurance costs.

   These are the variables we will need to create:
   - `age`: age of the individual in years
   - `sex`: 0 for female, 1 for male*
   - `bmi`: individual's body mass index
   - `num_of_children`: number of children the individual has
   - `smoker`: 0 for a non-smoker, 1 for a smoker
   
   In the code block below, create the following variables for a **28**-year-old, **nonsmoking woman** who has **three children** and a **BMI** of **26.2**.
   
   **Note**: We are using this [medical insurance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) as a guide, which unfortunately does not include data for non-binary individuals.
# create the initial variables below
age = 28
sex = 0
bmi = 26.2
num_of_children = 3
smoker = 0

## Working with the Formula
2. After the declaration of the variables, create a variable called `insurance_cost` that utilizes the following formula:

   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   insurance\_cost = 250*age - 128*sex \\
   + 370*bmi + 425*num\_of\_children \\
   + 24000*smoker - 12500 \\
   \end{aligned}
   $$
# Add insurance estimate formula below
insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
print(insurance_cost)
3. Let's display this value in an informative way. Print out the following string in the kernel:

   ```
   This person's insurance cost is {insurance_cost} dollars.
   ```
   
   You will need to use string concatenation, including the `str()` function to print out the `insurance_cost`.
print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
## Looking at Age Factor
4. We have seen how our formula can estimate costs for one individual. Now let's play with some individual factors to see what role each one plays in our estimation!

   Let's start with the `age` factor. Using a plus-equal operator, add 4 years to our `age` variable.
age += 4
print(age)
5. Now that we have changed our `age` value, we want to recalculate our insurance cost. Declare a new variable called `new_insurance_cost` in the code block below.

   Make sure you leave the `insurance_cost` variable the same as in Task 2. We will use it later in our program!
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
print(new_insurance_cost)
6. Next, we want to find the difference between our `new_insurance_cost` and `insurance_cost`. To do this, let's create a new variable called `change_in_insurance_cost` and set it equal to the difference between `new_insurance_cost` and `insurance_cost`.

   Note: depending on the order that we subtract (eg., `new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost` vs. `insurance_cost - new_insurance_cost`), we'll get a positive or negative version of the same number. To make this difference interpretable, let's calculate `new_insurance cost - insurance_cost`. Then we can say, "people who are four years older have estimated insurance costs that are `change_in_insurance_cost` dollars different, where the sign of `change_in_insurance_cost` tells us whether the cost is higher or lower".
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print(change_in_insurance_cost)
7. We want to display this information in an informative way similar to the output from instruction 3. In the code block below, print the following string, where `XXX` is replaced by the value of `change_in_insurance_cost`:

   ```
   The change in cost of insurance after increasing the age by 4 years is XXX dollars.
   ```
   
   Doing this will tell us how 4 years in age affects medical insurance cost estimates assuming that all other variables remain the same.
   
   You will need to concatenate strings and use the `str()` method.
print(f"""
The change in cost of insurance after increasing the age by 4 years is {change_in_insurance_cost} dollars.
""")
## Looking at BMI Factor
8. Now that you have looked at the age factor, let's move onto another one: BMI. First, we have to redefine our `age` variable to be its original value.

   Set `age` to `28`. This will reset its value and allow us to focus on just the change in the BMI factor moving forward.
   
   On the next line, using the plus-equal operator, add `3.1` to our `bmi` variable.
age = 28
print(bmi)
bmi += 3.1

print(age, bmi)
9. Now let's find out how a change in BMI affects insurance costs. Our next steps are pretty much the same as we have done before when looking at `age`.
   1. Below the line where `bmi` was increased by `3.1`, rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name `new_insurance_cost`.
   2. Save the difference between `new_insurance_cost` and `insurance_cost` in a variable called `change_in_insurance_cost`.
   3. Display the following string in the output terminal, where `XXX` is replaced by the value of `change_in_insurance_cost`:
   
   ```py
   The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing BMI by 3.1 is XXX dollars.
   ```
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print(f"""
The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing BMI by 3.1 is {change_in_insurance_cost} dollars
""")
## Looking at Male vs. Female Factor
10. Let's look at the effect sex has on medical insurance costs. Before we make any additional changes, first reassign your `bmi` variable back to its original value of `26.2`.

    On a new line of code in the code block below, reassign the value of `sex` to `1`. A reminder that `1` identifies male individuals and `0` identifies female individuals.
bmi = 26.2
sex = 1
11. Perform the steps below!
    1. Rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name `new_insurance_cost`.
    2. Save the difference between `new_insurance_cost` and `insurance_cost` in a variable called `change_in_insurance_cost`.
    3. Display the following string, where `XXX` is replaced by the value of `change_in_insurance_cost`:
    ```
    The change in estimated cost for being male instead of female is XXX dollars.
    ```
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print(f"""
The change in estimated cost for being male instead of female is {change_in_insurance_cost} dollars.
""")
12. Notice that this time you got a negative value for `change_in_insurance_cost`. Let's think about what that means. We changed the sex variable from `0` (female) to `1` (male) and it decreased the estimated insurance costs.

    This means that men tend to have lower medical costs on average than women. Reflect on the other findings you have dug up from this investigation so far.
""" People older tend to have higher medical costs than younger people 
People with a bigger bmi tend to have higher medical costs on average than thinner people
Males have less medical costs on average than women """
## Extra Practice
13. Great job on the project!!!

    So far we have looked at 3 of the 5 factors in the insurance costs formula. The two remaining are `smoker` and `num_of_children`. If you want to keep challenging yourself, spend some time investigating these factors!
    1. Rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name `new_insurance_cost`.
    2. Save the difference between `new_insurance_cost` in a variable called `change_in_insurance_cost`.
    3. Display the information below!
sex = 0
smoker = 1
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print(f"""
The change in estimated cost for being male instead of female is {change_in_insurance_cost} dollars.
""")
smoker = 0
num_of_children = 1
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print(f"""
The change in estimated cost for being male instead of female is {change_in_insurance_cost} dollars.
